# Project 3: Library of Books

* Author: Matthew Kelley
* Class: CS121 Section 003
* Semester: Fall 2020

## Overview

Console application to add books to your library. you can read them from
a text file located in the src directory. You can add books to your library,
delete books from your library, and print the books inside your library.

## Reflection

I enjoyed the project there is something fulfilling about organizing and
abstracting away all these features into class methods that we can easily
manipulate and use to create the functions of the application,
in essence OOP is super cool.

I had a difficult time getting the tests to pass for my program despite
following the project rubric word for word. Project was very similar to
project 2 so it wasn't much more leg work.

## Compiling and Using

In order to use the application you have to add the books to your library.
To do so once the application starts, the menu will prompt you with all the
features of the application. Enter "A" into the command line and it will prompt
you to input the attributes. To make sure that your book was added you may enter
"P" to the console to print the books that you have added. If you'd like to delete
a book in your library enter the index of the book. To bring up the menu again enter
"M" into the command line.
