## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a Java GUI based Tic Tac Toe game.

## Reflection

Each potential spot is represented by a position in a multi-dimensional array.
Inside the array we store BoardChoice enum object (X, O, or Open). Everytime a move is done,
the application will run the logic of whether or not the game has ended.
I created this with sort of a manual approach, I checked for a horizontal win
I checked for a vertical win, then I checked for a diagonal and inverse diagonal win,
and then lastly a tie.

There isn't much to say, It's a tic tac toe game. I didn't run into any trouble.
Very straight forward.

## Compiling and Using

Once you start the application, it plays like a normal game of tic tac toe.
You go first then the bot will select it's move. The application will determine
the winner or if the game has resulted in a tie.

## Sources used

I used no outside sources.
